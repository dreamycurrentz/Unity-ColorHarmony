					Color Harmony

Abstract: 

A color matching game built from scratch using Unity game engine. The player matches the color of the ball to the same color of the rotating arc in the direction indicated by the game and before the timer runs out.

Problem formulation:


Initial State: There will be a player ball and rotating arc. Operators: The ball moves in the swipe direction. Terminal test: It is done if the player is dead ie. if he hits the wrong color. Utility function: The game is totally random. One possibility is that the agent can find the speed of the rotator and can make movement based on that. But we can also measure score: the utility of a game for a player is the total score that the player has scored.

Softwares Used: 
Unity Game Engine, Maya, Photoshop.

Languages Used:
C#

Module description: 
• It is a single player game. 
• There will be an arc of different colors and it rotates randomly in different directions. 
• The goal of the player is to move the ball so that it matches with the correct color of the arc as that of the ball. 
• There is a timer constraint. The player has to match the colors before the timer runs out. 
• If the player hits correctly the score increases.
